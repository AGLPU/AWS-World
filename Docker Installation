Install Docker on Ubantu Linux:
Prerequisites:

Make sure your Linux distribution supports Docker.
Users need to have sudo privileges.
Steps:
Update the package index:

--- sudo apt-get update

Install Docker dependencies:
--- sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

Add Docker's official GPG key:
--- curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

Set up the stable Docker repository:
--- echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

Update the package index again:
--- sudo apt-get update

Install Docker:
--- sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

Start and enable Docker service:
--- sudo systemctl start docker
--- sudo systemctl enable docker

Verify the installation by running:
--- docker --version
--- docker run hello-world

Add your user to the Docker group:
--- sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}

Log out and log back in: For the group changes to take effect, you must either log out and log back in or restart the session:
--- exit

After exiting, log back in to your EC2 instance.
Verify the change: After logging back in, check if you can run Docker commands without sudo:
--- docker run hello-world
